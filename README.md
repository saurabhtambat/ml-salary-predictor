## Developer Salary Predictor

## Project Overview
The Software Developer Salary Predictor is a machine learning-based web application designed to estimate the salary of software developers based on key demographic and professional features. It utilizes a trained machine learning model, specifically using XGBoost for regression, which is integrated with Streamlit to create an interactive and user-friendly web interface.

## Variables Used:
- Age: The age group of the user (e.g., "25-34 years old", "35-44 years old").
- Country: The country in which the user is located (e.g., "United States of America", "India", "Germany").
- Education Level: The highest level of education completed (e.g., "Bachelor’s degree", "Master’s degree", "Professional degree").
- Years of Experience: The number of years the user has been working as a software developer.

## Features:
The model is built using XGBoost, a powerful and popular algorithm for structured data.
The interface of web app is built using Streamlit, which makes it highly interactive and easy to use.
